      <description>I am a tunnel ventilation engineer with a research background in fluid mechanics. As a doctoral researcher at the University of Oxford, I modelled the effects of realistic ocean conditions on tidal energy devices. I subsequently joined Atkins where I was involved in several major tunnel ventilation projects in the UK, USA and Middle East. I have been a member of the SNC-Lavalin tunnel ventilation team since early 2017, and have been working on the ongoing Eglinton Crosstown LRT and Confederation Line LRT as well as smaller consulting projects.</description>
