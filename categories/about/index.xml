      <description>As an engineering scientist at Coanda, I focus on computational modelling of complex fluid flows to solve immediate industrial challenges. Over the last ten years I have gained a broad range of experience as a mechanical engineer in academic and industrial settings.
My doctoral research at the University of Oxford examined the performance of tidal stream turbines in highly-turbulent open channel flows via CFD modelling.
As a tunnel ventilation engineer with Atkins and subsequently SNC-Lavalin, I developed expertise in numerical and physical modelling of heat and mass transport through tunnels and buildings.</description>
